Based on my analysis of the PRD documentation compared to the current codebase, here are the major features and requirements that have NOT been implemented yet:

9. Advanced Analytics

10. Provider Action Management

This analysis shows that while you have a solid foundation with authentication, basic dashboards, and payment processing, approximately 60-70% of the PRD requirements are still missing, particularly around email notifications, social media integrations, and action verification systems.
